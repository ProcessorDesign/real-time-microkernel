# Real-Time microkernel

Licensed under GPL 3.0

Basic Concepts
--------------

The micro kernel is architecture where there is a small basic kernel
of operating system and lose connected components as a seperate servers
or satelites around the kernel.

The architecture is more resistant to extensive system or hardware failures.
It can be used as a real-time and fail-proof system.
